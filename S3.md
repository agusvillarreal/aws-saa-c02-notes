- **Object based** -> Object-based storage allows you to upload files
- **Files up to 5 TB** -> Files can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB
- **Not OS or DB storage** -> Not suitable to install an operating system or run a database on
- **Unlimited Storage** -> The total volume of data and the number of objects you can store is unlimited

Files stored in buckets
HTTP 200 status code

### S3 objects tips
- Key
	- The object name (e.g `Ralphie.jpg` )
- Value
	- The data itself, which is made up of a sequence of bytes
- Version ID
	- Allows you to store multiple versions of the same object
- Metada
	- Data about the data you are storing (e.g., `content-type, last-modified`, etc)


## ACL vs Bucket policies
ACLs work on individual level
Bucket policy work on entire bucket

**Buckets are private by default**: When you create an S3 bucket, it is private by default (including all objects whitin it). You have to allow public access on both the bucket and its objects in order to make the bucket public.
**Objects ACLs**: You can make individual objects public using object ACLs
**Bucket policies**: You can make entire buckets public using bucket policies
**HTTP status code**: When you upload an object to S3 and it's succesful, you will receive an HTTP 200 code

## Host a static website
s3 scale automatically to meet demand

**Bucket policies**: Make entire buckets public using bucket policies
**Static Content:** Use S3 to host static content only -> database connection
**Automatic Scaling:** S3 scales automatically with demand

## Versioning 
Multiple version of an object within S3 
**All versions**: All versions of an object are stored in S3. This includes all writes and even in you delete an object
**Backup**: Can be a great backup tool
**Cannot be disabled**: Once enabled, versioning cannot be disbled - only suspenden 
**Lifecycle Rules**: Can be integrated with lifecycle rules
**Support MFA**: Can support mult-factor authentication
Delete marker when eliminating

_The objects that are public and when versioning is enable, it doesn't get public the previous version of the object_

## Storage classes
| Storage class                 | Use Case                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| S3 Standard                   | Suitable for most workloads (e.g., websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming applications, and big data analytics) |
| S3 Standard-Infrequent Access | Long-term, infrequently accessed critical data (e.g., backups, data store for disaster recovery files, etc)                |
| S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access | Long-term, infrequently accessed, non-critical data                                                                        |
| S3 Glacier                    | Long-term data archiving that ocassionally needs to be accessed within a few hours or minutes                              |
| S3 Glacier Deep Archive       | Rarely accessed data archiving with a default retrieval time of 12 hours (e.g., financial records for regulatory purposes) |
| S3 intelligent - tiering      | Unknown or unpredictable acess patterns                                                                                    |

## Lifecycle management
Lifecycle management automates moving your objects between the different storage tiers

- Automates moving objects between different sotrage tiers.
- Can be used in conjunction  with versioning
- Can be applied to current versions and previous versions

## S3 Object lock and glacier vault
Object lock -> WORM (write once, read many)
Regulatory mandate
Governance mode -> users cant' overwrite or deelte an object version or alter its lock settings
Permission to alter the retention settings

Complicance mode -> protected object version can't be overwritten by any user

Glacier vault lock

#### S3 Object lock
- Use **S3 Object lock** to store objects using a write once, read many (WORM) model
- Object lock can be on **individual objects** or applied **across the bucket** as a whole
- Object Lock comes in two modes: **governance mode** and **compliance mode**

| Compliance Mode                                                                                                                           | Governance Mode                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| With compliance mode, a protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user in your AWS account | With governance mode, users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock setings unless they have special permissions |

#### S3 Glacier vault lock -> WORM MODELS WITH GLACIER
- S3 Glacier Vault lock allows you to **easily deploy** and **enforce compliance controls** for individual S3 Glacier vaults with a vault lock policy
- You can **specify controls, such as WORM, in a vault lock policy and lock the policy from future edits**. Once locked, the policy can no longer be changed
S3 WORM MODEL 

## Encrypting S3 Objects
1. Encyption in transit
	- SSL/TLS -> Certificates
	- HTTPS -> Port 443
2. Encryption at Rest: Server-Side encryption
	- SSE-S3: S3 managed keys, using AES 256-bit encryption
	- SSE-KKMS: AWS Key management service-managed keys
	- SSE-C: customer handles the keys
3. Client-Side Encryption
	- You encrypt the files yourself before you upload them to S3
4. Enforcing Encryption with a Buckey Policy
	- A bucket policy can deny all `PUT` request that don't include the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` parameter in the request header

## Optimizing S3 performance
Prefixes -> folders (subfolder)inside the buckets  (directory)
ex.
`mybucketname/folder1/subfolder1/myfile.jpg`  > /folder1/subfolder1
`mybucketname/folder1/subfolder2/myfile.jpg`  > /folder1/subfolder2
JUST THE FOLDER
You can also achieve a high number of request: **3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE** and **5,500 GET/HEAD** request per second, per prefix
You can get better performance by spreading your reads across **different prefixes**. For example, if you are using **2 prefixes**, you can achieve **11,000 requests per second**

If you are using SSE-KMS to encrypt your objects in S3, you must keep in mind the KMS limits
- Uploading/downloading will count toward the **KMS quota**
- Region-specific, however, it's either **5,500, 10,000, or 30,000** requests per second
- Currently, you **cannot** request a quota increase for KMS

Use **multipart uploads** to increase performance when **uploading files** to S3
Should be used for any file **over 100 MB** and must be used for any file **over 5 GB**
Use **S3 byte-range fetches** to increase performance when **downloading files** to S3

## Backing up Data With S3 replication
Replicating objects from one bucket to another -> versioning must be enable 
1. You can **replicate objects** from one bucket to another
2. Objects in an existing bucket are not **replicated automatically**
3. Delete markers are **not replicated by default**
if versioning is suspended and the object is deleted, it's gone forever

Cross region -> S3 replication
